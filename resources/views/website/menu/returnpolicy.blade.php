                    The product must be unused, unworn, unwashed and without any flaws. Fashion products can be tried on to see if they fit and will still be considered unworn. If a product is returned to us in an inadequate condition, we reserve the right to send it back to you.

If the product was delivered in a second layer of Daraz packaging, it must be returned in the same condition with return shipping label attached. Do not put tape or stickers on the manufacturers box.
                    While you return the item at our hub, please collect the Daraz Return Acknowlegement Form from the Hub and fill it in by yourself. Keep one copy to yourself and we will keep another copy of it for the record.
